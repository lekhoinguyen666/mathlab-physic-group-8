Physic group 8

Since our code depend on each other, to test your code, RUN at index file 

Git practices
- Each people only modify their file
- When start working, PULL project
- When done/stop working, COMMIT and PUSH (recommend doing small, meaningful pushes)

- To reset git credential in MATLAB: 
Home -> Setting -> Source Control -> Git -> Under credentials click "Clear credentials"

Project 8: Determining the electric field energy density distribution

1. Content
The relationship between electric field strength and electric potential is represented by the expression: E = -grad(V)

The electric field energy density can be calculated using the formula: u = (1/2)*ε₀|E|²

This project requires students to use Matlab to calculate and plot the graph of the electric field energy density distribution according to the potential distribution on a known plane.

2. Requirements
1) Students should have basic programming knowledge of MATLAB.
2) Learn about symbolic calculation and graphical interpretation in MATLAB.

3. Tasks
Write Matlab program to:
1) Enter expression of electric potential as function of variables x and y.
2) Create a mesh matrix on the Oxy plane.
3) Calculate the electric field energy density at the nodes on the grid.
4) Draw three-dimensional graphs showing electric potential distribution in the plane Oxy and electric field energy density on z-axis.

Note: Students can use other non-symbolic approaches.
Submitting report has to contain text explaining the content of the program and the entire code verified to run properly in Matlab.
